* Use LOAD_ADDRESS in cLikeTests
* streq
* dec2str
* Print numeric
* Support IF
* Check that secondaries handle recursion
* Change data stack to a bigger size
* Should VSP point to the last element? instead of next free slot.
* Test runInterpreter on a primary


TEN-24-07: 2024-02-07 - Interpreter Start
* Develop a do-nothing secondary to drive out the interpreter
* Develop a 1+2 secondary
* Develop the secondary interpreter

TEN-24-06: 2024-02-06 - To Add and Beyond
* Note: Stack pointer points to the next place to write
* Develop add primary
* Started building the interpreter (for secondaries & primaries)

TEN-24-05: 2024-02-05 - Stack Primaries
* Check print - uses x10 - is that callee can trash?
* Develop push 

TEN-24-04: 2024-02-01 - Primaries and Secondaries
* Looked at a scheme for building primary and secondary code blocks
* Tried to build a primary - ran into a major barrier that you can't put relocatable addresses of code into data statements (Mac assembler limitation).
* Explored Mudshark666's idea of building a table of BL instructions, then digging the addresses out. Looks feasible. 
* We worked out how BL works: has 24 bits of room for a PC-relative address offset. The target address is right-shifted twice (as instruction addresses must be on 32-bit boundaries), then it's two high bytes are masked off. Bit 24 tells you whether it's a positive or negative offset.

TEN-24-03: 2024-01-31 - Print
* Use "make && ./unitTestDemo.out" to run more quickly 
* Extracted cLikeTests.s and asUnit.s, and adjusted makefile
* Make a c-like print function that takes an asciz string
* Improve test framework to print test name and pass or fail

TEN-24-02: 2024-01-30 - Unit Testing Framework
* Write a simple xUnit:
  + Write TEST_START and TEST_END macros
  + Moved test macros to asUnit.mnacros
* Used TDD to create a strlen function
* Moved strlen to cLike.s

TEN-24-01: 2024-01-29 - Introducing Tenth
* "Hello World" in assembler
* Figure out procedure calls (wasn't pushing LR)
* Figure out simple macros for exit and print
* Start creating a simple xUnit


xunit -
* test runner
* assertions
* reporting

create a procedure - a "normal" one
code
call assert
exit
