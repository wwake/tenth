* Make a c-like print function that takes an asciz string
* Improve test framework to show test name and pass or fail
* Idea from MudShark666: You can put all source files in a folder then use "cat folder/*.s > merged.s"

* Develop a "primary" routine
* Develop a secondary routine and interpreter

TEN-24-03: 2024-01-31 - Print
* Use "make && ./unitTestDemo.out" to run more quickly 
* Extracted cLikeTests.s and asUnit.s, and adjusted makefile

TEN-24-02: 2024-01-30 - Unit Testing Framework
* Write a simple xUnit:
  + Write TEST_START and TEST_END macros
  + Moved test macros to asUnit.mnacros
* Used TDD to create a strlen function
* Moved strlen to cLike.s

TEN-24-01: 2024-01-29 - Introducing Tenth
* "Hello World" in assembler
* Figure out procedure calls (wasn't pushing LR)
* Figure out simple macros for exit and print
* Start creating a simple xUnit


xunit -
* test runner
* assertions
* reporting

create a procedure - a "normal" one
code
call assert
exit
